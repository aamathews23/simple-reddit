# Simple Reddit

A simple portal that allows you to view 25 Reddit posts at a time. The application will default to posts from `r/popular`, but you can use the search bar to query _**anything!**_

The goal of this application was to expirement with **Redux**, **Styled Components**, and just some overall **UI / UX design** skills.

## Features
- Post grid that shows 25 posts based on the current search.
- Post cards that link to the Reddit post, subreddit, or user.
- Search bar to allow the user to run new searches.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Search history side bar which shows the current search, and running history of the last 16 searches. _(not available on mobile)_

## Future features
- Dark mode.
- Mobile version of the search history that is displayed in a drawer component or similar.
